# 🐚 Custom Unix Shell

A lightweight, Unix-like command-line shell built in C as part of the [CodeCrafters](https://www.codecrafters.io/) Unix Shell challenge. This shell provides a seamless and user-friendly command-line experience, featuring built-in commands, robust input parsing, file redirection, history management, and autocompletion.

## 🌟 Features

* 💻 **Built-in Commands**

  Supports common shell commands, including:

  * `cd` (Change directories)
  * `echo` (Display messages)
  * `exit` (Quit the shell)
  * and more!

* 🏃‍♂️ **External Command Execution**

  Executes standard Unix commands by forking and managing child processes.

* 🔍 **Input Parsing**

  Smart handling of:

  * Quoted strings ("text")
  * Escape sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\t`)
  * Arbitrary whitespace
  * Edge cases in user input (no command left behind!)

* 📂 **File Redirection**

  Supports input (`<`), output (`>`), and append (`>>`) redirection.

* ⏳ **Command History**

  Tracks your executed commands and allows you to easily recall and reuse them. No more typing the same thing twice!

* ⌨️ **Autocompletion**

  Tab-based autocompletion for commands, file paths, and more for an enhanced user experience.

## 👨‍💻 About

This project was built as part of the [CodeCrafters](https://www.codecrafters.io/) Unix Shell challenge. The goal? To implement a shell from scratch in C and dive deep into system-level programming. While certain parts could be optimized using existing libraries, I decided to implement them myself for the maximum learning experience.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Install dependencies (make sure you have `gcc` or another C compiler installed):

   * **On Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, etc.):**

     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
     ```
   * **On macOS (using Homebrew):**

     ```bash
     brew install readline
     ```

2. Run the shell (compiles and starts the shell):

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

## 🎮 Usage

Once the shell is running, you can:

* Execute built-in or external commands
* Use redirection like `ls > files.txt` to capture output
* Recall previous commands with up/down arrows
* Use Tab for autocompletion of file/command names (no more typos!)

### 📝 Example

```bash
$ echo "Hello, Shell!"
Hello, Shell!

$ cd /home/user

$ ls -la > out.txt

$ cat out.txt
```

## 📦 Dependencies

* C Standard Library (stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h, unistd.h, fcntl.h, sys/wait.h, etc.)
* Readline Library (readline/readline.h and readline/history.h)

  * Installation steps above
* POSIX-compliant system (Linux, macOS)
